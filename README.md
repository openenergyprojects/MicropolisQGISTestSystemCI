# MicropolisQGISTestSystemCI
QGIS based test system for mapping interdependencies of critical infrastructures in smart cities

Virtual City Infrastructure.
Our contribution is the design and implementation of the power, water and telecommunication systems infrastructure within the Micropolis virtual city project.

All design calculations and methodologies for modeling critical infrastructures interdependencies are given in the paper below.

# HOW TO USE:
The files are for QGIS program to map the systems.
Integration with Matlab has been made in order to create the parameters layer of each infrastrucutre. These are under the matlab folder.
